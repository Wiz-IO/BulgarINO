# BulgarINO / БългарINO 
( the name is just a joke )
# IoT Concept

In short: For the last 10 years I have been trying to make Things easier<br>
Some time ago I had to design a cheap EV Charger ( EVSE )<br>

Trivial and cheap solution, the part **HMI-IoT** I designed it with ESP32 + RMII + LTE

* ESP32 - connection to the EV controller, Display ( HMI ) and WiFi ( for local remote control )
* RMII - Ethernet - Internet capability
* LTE - as RMII
By the way ESP32 + RMII + LTE is the most used combination for industrial purposes
