In short: For the last 10 years I have been trying to make Things easier<br>
Some time ago I had to design a cheap EV Charger ( EVSE )<br>
![hmi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wiz-IO/BulgarINO/main/images/hmi-iot.jpg) 
Trivial and cheap solution, the part **HMI-IoT** I designed it with ESP32 + RMII + LTE

* ESP32 - connection to the EV controller, Display ( HMI ) and WiFi ( for local remote control )
* RMII - Ethernet - Internet capability
* LTE - as RMII
  
By the way ESP32 + RMII + LTE is the most used combination for industrial purposes<br>

Due to the fact that the PCB board had to be of minimal dimensions, I stacked the components several times<br>
- Damn it... it's the 21st century, Isn't there some **SMART** solution to the above combination<br>
I'm very familiar with what's on the market and started searching the web for: **a cheap and easy solution** <br>
